- Apply the sample code from: https://gitpitch.com/maeddes/gitpitch-spring-configuration
- Enable all actuator endpoints
- Enable only distinct actuator endpoints (env, configprops, health, info)
- Read and expose properties read from the application.properties file using:
  - @Value
  - @ConfigurationProperties
- Implement an own property file and reference it
- Observe the application behaviour when changing the properties using actuator
- Override an application property using -D in the maven call
- Implement 2 different configurations using profiles by using
  - different files with different names
  - one single yaml file with different profiles
- Switch between two database configurations (e.g. h2 and postgres) using profiles
